replace `apiKey` variable in `src/environments` files with the newly acquired **public** key.

```
export const environment = {
  ...
  apiEndpoint: 'http://gateway.marvel.com/v1/public/',
  apiKey: '<Your public key here>'
};
```

Run `ng serve` to start the application. You will then be able to access it at http://localhost:4200
